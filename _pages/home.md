Hello! I am 4th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at UC Santa Barbara. My research fields are labor economics and public economics. I am interested in investigating outcomes at the intersection of education, crime, and immigration. My current lines of research focus on the labor market and demographic effects of managed migration and the impact of college-level remedial education reform in the community college system.

I am a former Sally Casanova Predoctoral Scholar and am currently a Graduate Student Fellow at the UCSB Broom Center for Demography. I am also an associate professor of economics at Santa Barbara City College. Prior to joining the doctoral program in 2019, I was a lecturer at San Diego State University and worked for the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Economic Research Bureau and UCSB's Economic Forecast Project.
